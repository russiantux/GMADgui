# GMADgui Source-Code
I've decided to release the source code since I'm pounded (heh) with college and other projects that I've focused my time into.


## License
>I've decided to make my own license for this. 
>You're allowed to: fork it over to make your own version, and you're also welcome to put in merge-requests if you feel like you've added something good to the program, and you are also allowed to fork the code, make your own changes, and upload it somewhere else AS LONG as I'm credited with the original code. You are however **NOT** allowed to: Fork over the code, and slap your own name and call it your own program (without any major changes), and you are also not allowed to sell the program at all, doing so will lead to issues from me and the Dev of MetroUI(if he feels like going stuff like that)
